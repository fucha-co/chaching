It’s (j)ust (e)leventy and (t)ailwind … OK, and a few other things; it’s still *really* small though.

## Goal
[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (combined with [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/)) are my favorite things right now.

While learning how to use Eleventy, I came across [a few starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) that combine it with Tailwind CSS and PurgeCSS, which is _amazing_, but they also come with so much more.

Personally, I _only_ want Eleventy, Tailwind, and PurgeCSS … and, taking the desire for simplicity one step further, I only want to use them via NPM scripts.

So, I made this thing and it seems to work 🤷‍♀️

## How you can use it
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Start development: `npm run dev`
4. Visit http://localhost:8080 to see your work-in-progress
5. Do super-fun Eleventy and Tailwind things
6. When you’re done: `npm run build`

That’s it 🕺


## Disclaimer
I built this in about an hour through trial-and-error, so I'm sure there's _a lot_ of room for improvement.

If you try it, find issues and/or think of improvements, please file an issue and/or submit a pull request.
